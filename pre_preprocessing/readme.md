The preprocessing is done by running:

1.gct2npy.py

2.kmeans.py

3.nodup_idx.py

4.bgedv2.py

5.bgedv2_reqnorm.py

6.bgedv2_norm.py

7.GTEx.py

8.GTEx_reqnorm.py

9.GTEx_norm.py

in order.

After preprocessing, you should have the preprocessed data for the future experiments:













Please put them in the root folder NCNN.

### Readme for NCNN
#### Prerequisites
Python 3.

Pytorch 1.11

Pytorch-geometric

#### Data
The original data files are not provided within this codebase, as some of them require applying for access. Once you download all of them, please put them in this codebase.

##### GEO and GTEx
The GEO and GTEx data we used in our paper is a third-party data available atÂ https://cbcl.ics.uci.edu/public_data/D-GEX/. The authors had no special access privileges, and other researchers would be able to access this data in the same manner. The data you will download is:

bgedv2_QNORM.gctx and GTEx_RNASeq_RPKM_n2921x55993.gctx.

Please put the downloaded file in the folder preprocessing

The GEO and GTEx data we used in our paper is collected by emailing (yil8@uci.edu). For those who want to have the data, please reach https://github.com/uci-cbcl/D-GEX for further information.

##### Gene graph data
The gene interaction graph data can be downloaded form 

https://string-db.org/cgi/download.pl?sessionId=qJO5wpaPqJC7&species_text=Homo+sapiens.

After downloading the file'9606.protein.links.detailed.v11.5.txt', please put it in datastore folder.

The file 'Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.95.gtf' can be downloaded from :

ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-95/gtf/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.95.gtf.gz

Please put the downloaded file in datastore folder.

#### Model
The proposed method NCNN is implemented and tested on two dataset-GEO dataset and GTEx dataset with two python files:

geo_NCNN_table.py and GTE_x_NCNN_table.py


The GCN model is implemented and tested on two dataset-GEO dataset and GTEx dataset with two python files:

geo_gcn_table.py and GTE_x_gcn_table.py
